        <p>I have earned a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Southern Utah
            University (SUU) and a PhD in e-Learning from North Central University (NCU) in Prescott, Arizona. My
            dissertation focused on the delivery aspect on online courses.
            <br><br>
            I enjoy the challenge of working with students in higher education, particularly in online courses, trying
            to foster a sense of community where you may never 'see' your instructor or fellow classmates. I continue to
            research in the areas of assessment in online courses.
