    <p>I have earned a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Southern Utah University (SUU) and a PhD in e-Learning from North Central University (NCU) in Prescott, Arizona. My dissertation focused on the delivery aspect on online courses.

        I enjoy the challenge of working with students in higher education, particularly in online courses, trying to foster a sense of community where you may never 'see' your instructor or fellow classmates. I continue to research in the areas of assessment in online courses.

        My goal with design - "But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another." Mosiah 4:15</p>
